Explain project architecture:
Large Image -> Pre-processing Module -> Object Detection -> Pre-processing Module -> Binary CNN Classification -> Post-Processing Module 

Goal of first pre-processing module:
	Make the task of object detection easier for the object detection algorithm
	Inpired by Object detection with image segmentation (show image)
	Say that we tried Object Detection through Image Segmentation (Selective Search)
	Also tried Google's Faster-RCNN with ResNet CNN trained with Coco-Dataset 
	Say that Visal will explain why these didnt work

First pre-processing module attempt:
	Using Python Image Library : PIL
	Retrieve the image
	Greyscale the image
	Increase contrast to 300% so that the black colors get darker and white colors get whiter
	Show Img5.png 
	Show Img1.png, was really happy until tried another image
	Show Img6.png, next slide
	Show Img2.png, image contained too much noise

Second pre-processing module attempt:
	Using Open-CV2 Python API
	Retrieve the image 
	Use a binary treshhold for binary color scheme in image
	Erosion followed by Dilation using a 5 x 5 kernel
	Patch minor holes in the image through dilation followed by erosion
	Force the image to be greyscale
	Show difference between pre-cleaned Img2.png and Img3.png
	Show threshold of 130 Img7, 100 Img8, 80 Img9
	Show Img9 and Img6 Side by side and show that all the ships were captured
	Divided the values by 255, so image is now a mask of 0 and 1 values, gave it to Visal

Third pre-processing module attempt:
	Using Open-CV2 Python API
	Retrieve the image
	Use a binary threshhold with a high value (104) so that less whites show
	Erosion followed by Dilation using a 3x3 kernel
	Dilate the image again in order to fill in the empty spots using a 4x4 kernel and 2 iterations
	Erode the image to get reduce the now bloated size of ships using a 2x2 kernel and 1 iteration
	Show different between image 9 and image 10, it keeps alot more of the information and connects everything together
	Show image11 and then image 12 and the difference


Object Detection:
	Based on your research, say why Selective Search doesn't work
	Faster-RCNN with ResNet CNN does not work because the network was not trained with satelite ship images
	Object detection should work on ships that are bigger than 80 by 80 too

	Show your attempts and report your image attempts based off on Img5.png

Second Pre-Processing Module:
	Scale down the image sizes

Binary CNN Classification:
	CNN tells us which bounding boxes to keep and throw away
	Draw bounding box on images using post-processing module

Post-Processing Module:
	Draws bounding boxes
